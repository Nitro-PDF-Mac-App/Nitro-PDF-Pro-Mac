Whether you‚Äôre editing, converting, reviewing, or securing PDFs, Nitro delivers a polished and reliable experience built specifically for Mac users who value performance and precision.

For professionals who collaborate regularly, Nitro PDF includes intuitive markup tools such as highlights, sticky notes, and drawing features. These tools make it easy to share feedback, review contracts, and finalize documents efficiently. Built-in digital signing functionality enables users to securely sign and verify documents without needing third-party plugins.  

The app emphasizes both productivity and security. With advanced encryption and password controls, you can safeguard sensitive information while maintaining compliance with corporate or legal requirements. Cloud integration allows you to sync documents between your devices, enabling seamless access wherever you work.  

Optimized for Apple Silicon, Nitro PDF operates with incredible speed and efficiency on macOS, even when handling large or complex files. Its interface feels native to the platform ‚Äî clean, modern, and intuitive ‚Äî ensuring that every action feels natural.
